### Thermostat-Project
CS 350 Thermostat Project Reflection
# Summary of the Project
This project was all about building a basic thermostat system that can manage room temperature. It solves the problem of keeping the temperature steady by letting users adjust it with buttons. The system changes the temperature and uses an LED to simulate a heater and cooling units with red and blue lights. It can also react to things like the heat from a finger on the temperature sensor, which simulates real environmental changes.
# What I Did Well
I was able to set up all the key parts—buttons, LEDs, temperature sensor, and system communication—without much trouble. Error handling went smoothly too, which made the whole system run more reliably. 
# Where I Could Improve
I had issue getting the placement of the button.  I just started from scratch and rewired all the buttons, lights and LCD screen to fit correctly for this project.
# Tools and Resources I’m Adding to My Support Network
For future projects, I’ll keep leaning on helpful stuff like dev boards, datasheets for sensors, and online communities when I get stuck or need advice.
# Transferable Skills
This project gave me hands-on experience with hardware setup, using interrupts, and working through bugs—skills that will definitely come in handy in other classes or projects, especially anything dealing with embedded systems.
# How I Kept It Maintainable
I kept things organized with clear function and variable names, and I broke the code into logical chunks. That way, it’s easy to update or tweak one part without messing up the rest.
